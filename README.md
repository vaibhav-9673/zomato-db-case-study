# Project Overview
Project Title: zomato-db-case-study
Database: zomato_db

The zomato-db-case-study project is a relational database system built using MySQL that simulates an online food delivery platform like Zomato.
It manages data related to customers, restaurants, riders, orders, menu items, deliveries, and reviews.
The schema is carefully designed with foreign keys, constraints, and indexes to maintain data integrity and optimize query performance.
Synthetic data is generated using Python Faker, ensuring realistic Indian names, addresses, and phone numbers, with timestamps distributed between 2020–2025.
This provides a large dataset to explore customer behavior, restaurant performance, menu popularity, delivery efficiency, and review analysis.
The project includes over 30 analytical SQL queries, such as identifying top customers, calculating revenue per restaurant, analyzing delivery times, and finding the most popular menu items.

# Objective
The main objective of the zomato-db-case-study project is to design and implement a relational database named zomato_db that simulates an online food delivery platform.
It focuses on:
1. Efficiently managing data for customers, restaurants, riders, orders, and reviews.
2. Practicing SQL queries to analyze customer behavior, restaurant performance, and order insights.
3. Creating a realistic dataset using Faker for hands-on learning.
4. Building a foundation for data analytics and decision-making in the food delivery industry.

# Project Structure
## 1. Database setup
Database Creation:
The project begins by creating a database named zomato_db to store all data related to the food delivery platform.

Table Creation:
Multiple tables are created to capture different entities in the system:

customers – stores customer details like name, phone number, email, city, address, and registration date.

restaurants – stores restaurant information including name, city, address, and operating hours.

riders – stores delivery partner details, signup date, rating, and active status.

orders – stores order information such as customer ID, restaurant ID, order datetime, status, total amount, and payment mode.

order_items – stores items in each order, including menu item ID, quantity, item price, and total price.

menu_items – stores menu details like item name, category, price, availability, and the restaurant it belongs to.

deliveries – stores delivery details including order ID, assigned rider, delivery status, pickup and delivery timestamps.

reviews – stores customer ratings and comments for both restaurants and riders.

Each table is designed with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to maintain referential integrity and ensure accurate relationships between customers, restaurants, orders, and deliveries.
